                                                                                  that is a joke.       1.00      1.00      1.00         1
                                             that is a lot of friends. do you have a best friend?       1.00      1.00      1.00         1
                                        that is a perfect reason to like a certain kind of music.       1.00      1.00      1.00         1
                                                            that is true. i hope it doesn't rain.       1.00      1.00      1.00         1
                                                that is true. the weather is constantly changing.       1.00      1.00      1.00         1

                                                        that means it gets twice as much traffic.       0.00      0.00      0.00         1
                                                                   that means it will get hotter.       1.00      1.00      1.00         1
                                                          that means month/day/year. use numbers.       1.00      1.00      1.00         1
                                                   that means we have to leave the house at 9:15.       1.00      1.00      1.00         1
